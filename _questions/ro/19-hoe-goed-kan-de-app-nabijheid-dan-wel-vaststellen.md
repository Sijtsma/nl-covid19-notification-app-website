When you receive a notification, in 90% of the cases you were:
- more than 15 minutes
- less than 3 meters from someone who turned out to be infected afterwards.The RIVM guidelines state that you are at a higher risk if you were within 1.5 meters.

Of all people who were within 1.5 meters, 75% appears to receive a notification. For example, the people who did not receive a message had the phone in their pocket.

Of all people further away than 1.5 meters, 25% will also receive a notification. Then they were almost always within 3 meters. Scientists say that is just enough.
