The app exchanges random codes with other phones. These codes do not contain any personal information about you or your location. The app therefore does not know who you are or where you are.

Even if you are infected with the corona virus and you report this via the app, this cannot be linked to your name or contact details. Moreover, you use the app completely voluntarily."
