If you get a notification, it means you have been near someone who has tested positive for coronavirus. Donâ€™t panic: this does not mean for sure that you have coronavirus too. It means you have been in a high-risk situation and that you could have been infected with coronavirus. 

You should stay at home for up to 10 days from the date of contact with an infected person. This will prevent you from infecting other people.
If you develop symptoms within those 10 days or afterwards, call [0800-1202](tel:+318001202) or visit [www.coronatest.nl](https://www.coronatest.nl) to arrange a coronavirus test, free of charge.
