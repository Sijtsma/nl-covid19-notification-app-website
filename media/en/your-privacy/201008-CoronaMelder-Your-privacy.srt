00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,320
The CoronaMelder app sends you a notification 

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,600
if you have been near someone who later tests positive for coronavirus.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,320
But does the app always know where you are? 

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,0
No. The app does not know where you are, or who you are.

5
00:00:18,0 --> 00:00:19,600
This is how it works: 

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,0
when your phone is near another phone that has the app, 

7
00:00:23,0 --> 00:00:28,560
the phones exchange a random code using bluetooth.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,400
The app remembers those codes... 

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,680
but it doesn’t know which phones they came from... or where you were.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,400
The app only knows if you were close to another phone that also had the app, 

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,560
and on which day it was.

12
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,880
So if you receive a notification, it won’t tell you who it came from.

13
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,440
And if you test positive for the virus yourself, 

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,960
you can choose whether to add your coronavirus status to the app

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,960
together with the GGD,

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,160
the Regional Public Health authority in the Netherlands.

17
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,560
Downloading the app is voluntary at all times.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:05,640
We can only get coronavirus under control together.

19
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,320
