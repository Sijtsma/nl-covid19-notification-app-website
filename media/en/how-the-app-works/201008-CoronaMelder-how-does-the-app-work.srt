00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,680
CoronaMelder. 

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,120
The app that helps you to avoid unknowingly infecting other people.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,680
How does it work?

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,80
After you downloading it, 

5
00:00:12,80 --> 00:00:15,720
the app exchanges codes with other phones that are nearby.

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,160
The app generates codes for every phone. 

7
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,680
These codes are random and change several times per hour. 

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,200
If you are near to someone else - for longer than 15 minutes - who also has the app, 

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,640
your phones will exchange codes using bluetooth.

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,440
But not if someone cycles past you in the street... 

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,680
only if you are near to each other for more than 15 minutes.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,240
CoronaMelder collects these codes in the app. 

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,280
Codes older than 14 days are deleted automatically.

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,920
So CoronaMelder has a list of random codes

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,680
 from other users who have been near to you in the past two weeks. 

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
But when and how do you receive a notification?

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,80
Let’s imagine that a week after you went out, another app user 

18
00:01:01,80 --> 00:01:05,280
– let's call him Max – tests positive for coronavirus. 

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,920
Together with the GGD, the Regional Public Health authority in the Netherlands,

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,440
Max can add his coronavirus status to the app. 

21
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,0
There is a special GGD key in the app. 

22
00:01:17,0 --> 00:01:20,920
Max passes this key on to the GGD health worker.

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,760
The GGD health worker enters the key. 

24
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,320
Now Max can activate the list of codes on his phone.

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,80
The app users belonging to those codes – including you! –   

26
00:01:32,80 --> 00:01:34,480
will then get a notification. 

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,920
What’s in the notification? And what should you do next? 

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
The notification tells you which day you came near to someone 

29
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,960
who has tested positive for coronavirus. 

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,280
It does not say who that person was, or where it happened. 

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,800
If you get a notification, it means there’s a chance that you also have coronavirus.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,560
The app will tell you what you can do next and whether you should get tested.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,320
In this way, new infections can be discovered faster, 

34
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,400
which helps you to avoid spreading  coronavirus to others.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,800
Downloading the app is voluntary at all times.

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,680
We can only get coronavirus under control together.

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,400
