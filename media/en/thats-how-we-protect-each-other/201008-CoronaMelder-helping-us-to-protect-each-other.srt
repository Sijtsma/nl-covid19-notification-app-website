00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,520
Here it is: the CoronaMelder app.

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,960
The Netherlands’ official coronavirus app.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,880
The app helps us to protect each other against coronavirus.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,160
You can pass on coronavirus to other people even before you have any symptoms.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,720
This means you can unknowingly infect many people.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,320
So it’s important to know as early as possible 

7
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,400
if there is a higher risk that you have been infected...

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,880
Then you can avoid passing on the virus to other people.

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,800
The CoronaMelder app helps you to do this.

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,720
It works like this...

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:40,480
If you’ve been near someone who later tests positive for coronavirus,

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,680
you will receive a notification.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,560
The app does not know who you are,

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,160
who the other person is, or where you came near to each other.

15
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,160
It only tells you which day it was.

16
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,280
The app will tell you what you can do next and whether you should get tested.

17
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,880
If you get a test and find out that you have the coronavirus,

18
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:04,0
the GGD, the Regional Public Health authority in the Netherlands,

19
00:01:04,0 --> 00:01:08,800
will ask you who you have been near to and then call those people.

20
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,360
But you don’t always know everyone you’ve been near to.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,640
You can add your coronavirus status to the app together with the GGD.

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,440
The CoronaMelder app will then immediately warn

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,880
everyone who has been near you.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,240
Whether you know them or not.

25
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,800
This only happens if:

26
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:32,120
they are also using the app and they were near you for more than 15 minutes.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:38,960
This means we can warn more people more quickly.

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,760
So each download of the CoronaMelder app

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,800
helps to stop the spread of the virus.

30
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,600
Downloading the app is voluntary at all times.

31
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,200
This is how we can protect each other.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,240
We can only get coronavirus under control together.

33
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,200
